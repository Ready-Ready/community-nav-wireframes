# Community Navigation Wireframes

Repository layout and quick start for working with exported model pages and wireframes.

Structure
- `model-pages/` — Source pages exported from Salesforce (one folder per page).
- `wireframes/` — Working prototypes and deliverables (one folder per wireframe).
- `docs/` — Final static site for GitHub Pages publishing.
- `assets/` — Shared images, fonts, and icons used across wireframes.

Guidance
- Export pages from Chrome as **Webpage, Complete** and place the resulting `index.html` and its `_files/` asset folder into `model-pages/<page-name>/`.
- I will read HTML, CSS, JS and image files directly from the repo to create wireframes in `wireframes/`.
- When a wireframe is ready to share, copy its built HTML into `docs/` to publish via GitHub Pages from the `main` branch.

Next steps
1. Add your exported homepage into `model-pages/homepage/` (see `model-pages/homepage/README.md`).
2. Tell me when it's uploaded and I'll inspect and begin the first wireframe.
