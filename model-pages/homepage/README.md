# Model page: homepage

Place your exported Salesforce homepage here. Export guidance:

- In Chrome, choose **Save as... → Webpage, Complete**.
- Copy the generated `index.html` and the `<page>_files/` folder into `model-pages/homepage/` so the layout and assets remain relative and intact.
- Keep the filenames as generated (e.g., `index.html`, `homepage_files/`), and avoid renaming asset files.

Naming convention
- Folder: `model-pages/<page-name>/` (use `homepage` for the site root).
- The main file should be `index.html` so I can open it directly.
