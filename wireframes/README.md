# Wireframes

Working prototypes and deliverables go in this folder. Recommended workflow:

- Create a folder per wireframe: `wireframes/<wireframe-name>/`.
- Include an `index.html`, a small `styles.css`, and a `notes.md` explaining decisions.
- When ready to publish to the client, copy the built output into `docs/` or point GitHub Pages to `docs/`.
